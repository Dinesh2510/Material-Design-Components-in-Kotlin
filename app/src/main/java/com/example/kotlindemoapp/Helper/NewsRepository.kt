Today, we received some confirmation that it wasn't a spur-of-the-moment thing.Several members of Tesla's board issued a joint statement on the company's investor-relations site. The statement says that Elon started discussing taking the company private with the board last week. The talks covered both the reasons for doing so -- which Musk also laid out in an email to employees that was subsequently posted online -- as well as the funding. That last part is important, because Tesla's going to need a lot of it.\",\n" +

Veridium Labs, with assistance from IBM, has launched a blockchain network designed to track how companies or other entities buy and sell carbon credits. Carbon credit systems cap allowed carbon dioxide releases but let companies that don't reach the cap sell credits to those who go over. Carbon credit systems also let companies pay others that do things like plant forests to offset their carbon emissions. So why use blockchain for it? In a nutshell, blockchain technology builds trust into any kind of system that records transactions.\",\n" +

Bleachings happen when the coral expels tiny algae, called zooxanthellae, that live inside it and provide its food and create its rainbow hues. Without zooxanthellae, the reef's tissue turns transparent and the coral starves. Global warming, fueled by our reliance on petroleum and coal, has pushed ocean temperatures 0.68 Celsius over the past century. That might not seem like much, but it's enough to prompt the coral and algae to abandon their symbiotic relationship. While coral doesn't die immediately, the bleachings have been intense enough to kill huge swaths of one of the world's most stunning natural wonders, including 29 percent of its shallow-water coral in 2016 alone.\",\n" +

It looks good, but not distractingly so, and I'm glad you get a couple color finishes to choose from. We got a white HomePod and while I like how it looks, I can easily imagine smudging it with repeat handling. The HomePod's mesh exterior isn't interchangeable like the Amazon Echo's removable shell.
